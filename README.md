# A-Diffusion-Model-Enabled-DRL-Approach-for-Secure-Data-Collection-in-UAV-Assisted-IoT-Networks

Abstract:
Leveraging the mobility and cost-effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they are frequently deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) systems to efficiently collect data from IoT devices (IoTDs). UAV wireless communication channels, due to their broadcast nature, are highly susceptible to eavesdropping, resulting in potential information leakage. In this paper, we investigate a dual-UAV-assisted IoT system aimed at enhancing the secrecy rate against multiple eavesdroppers. The primary UAV is responsible for collecting data from ground IoT devices, while the auxiliary UAV generates artificial noise (AN) to interfere with and disrupt eavesdroppers. Our goal is to minimize both the system's Age of Information (AoI) and UAV energy consumption by optimizing UAV trajectories and IoTD scheduling. Given the multi-objective nature of the problem and the dynamic environment, traditional optimization methods struggle to capture the system's complexity and effectively balance these objectives. Therefore, we propose a generative diffusion model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we leverage the efficient exploration and exploitation capabilities of diffusion models to enhance DRL performance, enabling the generation of more diverse and high-quality actions. We compare the proposed algorithm with several existing DRL benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing AoI performance and energy efficiency.
