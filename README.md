# A-Diffusion-Model-Enabled-DRL-Approach-for-Secure-Data-Collection-in-UAV-Assisted-IoT-Networks

Abstract:
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized for information collection in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to their flexibility and low operational costs, especially in time-sensitive applications. Despite their advantages, challenges remain in maintaining data freshness, ensuring communication security, and optimizing energy consumption in UAV-assisted IoT networks. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating the fresh and secure data collection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We consider a scenario where a primary UAV collects data from distributed IoT devices (IoTDs) by flying towards them, under the constraint of maintaining a non-negative residual energy level. To enhance communication security against potential eavesdroppers, a secondary UAV is introduced as a jammer that transmits artificial noise (AN). The joint optimization of both UAVs' flight trajectories aims to maximize the system's secrecy rate, minimize the weighted sum of the Age of Information (AoI), and reduce the energy consumption of both UAVs. To efficiently solve the high-dimensional MDP and overcome the curse of dimensionality, we propose a novel denoising diffusion probabilistic model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method (DDPM-TD3). This approach innovatively applies diffusion models to determine IoTD selection and UAV positioning decisions, effectively capturing the complex dynamics and trade-offs inherent in the problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional deployment strategies and existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks. The results highlight improvements in secrecy rate, data freshness, and energy efficiency, validating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing UAV-assisted IoT networks.
